A One Time Pad encryption program written using C++

The One Time Pad is a symmetric key encryption algorithm. The key should be as long as the message and used once.
Each character in the text is combined with a character from the key and an XOR operation is then performed.
The security of a one time pad depends on the randomness of the key which should be used only once
